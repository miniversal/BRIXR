# BRIXR
A competitive/co-op super break/pong clone


<p>Two players can controller separate paddles on either end of the screen. If there's only one player, that player can control both paddles individually or by using either paddle. Each paddle's score is tracked separately but there is also a combined scored for those that choose more cooperative play.</p>

<p>Brix spawn between the paddles at random intervals. Breaking a brix results in scoring points but also may have a random effect on the ball's behavior. Some brix will increase the speed of the ball, some will slow it down, others will reverse the direction of the ball. You never know what might happen!</p>
